Task 2: Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (submit html on GS)
A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) that helps the audience understand the data (include a citation as necessary) and what you’ll be exploring
For Task 2, use hierarchical clustering by complete linkage to create a dendrogram showing multivariate clustering for water chemistry by site.
To perform hierarchical clustering by site, you’ll want to make a data frame that has a single summary row per site (e.g. based on means from all observations at that site), then calculate the Euclidean distance before performing complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

```{r}
#read in the data 
stream_chemistry <- read_csv(here("data", "sbc_lter_registered_stream_chemistry.csv"))
```

```{r}
#creating a dendrogram
peng_dist <- dist(penguins_scale, method = 'euclidean') 
   ### also look at upper and diag arguments
 
### Hierarchical clustering (complete linkage)
peng_hc_complete <- hclust(peng_dist, method = "complete")
 
### Plot it (base plot):
plot(peng_hc_complete, cex = 0.6, hang = -1)
```

```{r}
### use cutree to slice it into three clusters
peng_cut_hc <- cutree(peng_hc_complete, 3)
table(peng_cut_hc, penguins_complete$species)
```

All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages suppressed) you wrote to wrangle data then create the dendrogram, and to create a professional looking dendrogram that appears (with a caption) in your knitted HTML.
